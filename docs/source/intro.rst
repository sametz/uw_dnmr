UW-DNMR v0.3.0 (alpha)
**********************

.. image:: _static/images/screenshot.png

**UW-DNMR** (Un-Windowed Dynamic NMR; pronounced "You Dee En Em Arr") is a
Python implementation of the core features of WinDNMR by Hans Reich. The
long-term goal is to replicate the features of WinDNMR and to provide a
useful open-source application for Mac and Linux as well as Windows.

A secondary, (overly?)ambitious goal is to provide code and documentation of
sufficient quality that it can serve as a tutorial for others on how to
simulate NMR spectra and create a scientific application in Python.
