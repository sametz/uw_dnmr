Features
========

Currently uw-dnmr can simulate the following systems for spin-1/2 nuclei:

* First-Order multiplets
* Non-quantum mechanical solutions for common second-order patterns:

  * AB
  * AB\ :sub:`2`
  * ABX
  * ABX\ :sub:`3`
  * AA'XX'
  * AA'BB'

* Second-order spin systems of up to 8 nuclei
* Dynamic NMR (DNMR) lineshapes for:

  * two uncoupled nuclei
  * two coupled nuclei
