Hans Reich (University of Wisconsin-Madison) kindly shared his original Visual Basic 6 code,
which served as a guide to recreating the functionality and structure of WinDNMR.

The :code:`nmrsim` library provides the functions used to calculate the NMR lineshapes.
See `the nmrsim project`_ for details.
