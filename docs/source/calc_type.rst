Calculation Type Selection
--------------------------

The **Calc Type** menu lets you choose from three submenus of models:

* **Multiplet:** Simulation of first-order multiplets ("**1stOrd**"),
  plus common second-order patterns such as AB, ABX and AA'XX'
  that have algebraic solutions
  (i.e. quantum mechanical solutions are not required).
* **ABC...:** Second-order (quantum-mechanical) simulation of up to 8 coupled nuclei.
  ('ABC...' refers to the Pople nomenclature convention of using a different upper-case letter
  for each set of chemical shift-nonequivalent nuclei, e.g. AB; AB\ :sub:`2`)
* **DNMR:** Dynamic NMR lineshape simulations.
