# Developer Log

Initiated to keep track of issues encounntered while returning to work on the project.

## 2023-02-28

- Need to use a conda environment on my macbook. 
  Using a .venv kept resulting in the following error:
`qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "cocoa" in 
"/Users/geoffreysametz/Documents/GitHub/uw_dnmr/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/PySide2/Qt/plugins"
even though it was found.                                          
This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.`
- All tests are passing except `test_dnmr_bar_instantiates`, 
  which isn't using a proper stub.
  However, have code coverage without it.
  Marking test to skip for now, pending deletion
